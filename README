thinj
=====

thinj is a 'linker' that converts a bunch of java class files to a self contained binary. 

Building
========

To build all the artifacts:

thinjrt/build.sh
thinjvm/build.sh
thinj/build.sh
thinjregression/build.sh

When all these have succeeded, a binary 'alltests' can be found in thinjregression. 
This binary will run the regression suite.

Dependencies
============
thinj Depends on:
* j2sdk 1.6.0
* bcel 5.2 (http://commons.apache.org/bcel)
